# Image-Recognition-Neural-Networks

Within this project an image-classification problem will be analysed. Its core will be the optimization of the modelâ€™s hyperparameters via grid-search. To do this I will wrap Keras models in scikit-learn and I will choose the most convenient parameters for activation function, neuron numbers, kernel initializer and dropout ratio. The main objective of my project is to show how much models performances vary across nonspecific state-of-the-art algorithms and simple algorithms suited for our specific dataset.

In file presentation_machine_learning.pdf you will find the project defense' presentation, in file Project_Neural_Network.ipynb/pdf you will find the notebook containing the code and the written resume of the project.
